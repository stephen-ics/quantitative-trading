    - Pair Trades: A type of hedged trade where you take long and short positions in two related assets to profit from the relative performance
- Market Neutral Portfolios:
    - Aims to have a beta close to zero
    - Beta: A measure of a portfolio's volatility relative to the overall market, indicates how much the portfolio's returns are expected to move in relation to market returns
        - Beta = 1: The portfolio or security is expected to move in line with the market (if market goes up by 1%, portfolio goes up by 1% V.V)
        - Beta > 1: The portfolio or security is expected to be more volatile than the market (a beta of 1.5 means if the market goes up by 1%, the portfolio is expected to go up by 1.5%)
        - Beta < 1: The portfolio is expected to be less volatile than the market, a beta of 0.5 means if the market goes up by 1% the portfolio goes up by 0.5%
        - Beta = 0: The portfolio is expected to have no correlation with market movements
