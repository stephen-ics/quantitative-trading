# Chapter 3: Backtesting
### Common Backtesting Platforms
#### Excel
- This is the most basic and common tool for traders, whether retail or institutional
- You can enhance its power further if you can write Visual Basic macros
- The beauty of Excel is "What you see or what you get" (or WSYIWYG in computing terminology)
- Data and program are also all in one place so that nothing is hidden
- A common backtesting pitfall called the "look-ahead bias" is unlikely to occur in Excel (unless you use macros, which renders it no longer WSYIWYG)
- Another advantage of Excel is that often backtesting and live trade generation can be done from the same spreadsheet, eliminating any duplication or programming efforts
- The major disadvantage of Excel is that it can be used to backtest only fairly simple models, but simple models are often the best!
